            </dd>
            <dt>What is the closest train station to the park?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">Amtrak rail lines parallel the southern and southwestern borders of the park. Amtrak

            </dd>
            <dt>What transportation is available within the park?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">In addition to private automobiles, guided tours are available in the main sections of
                the park. Contact Glacier
                Park, Inc. and Sun Tours for information (see addresses and telephone numbers below). Rental cars are

                in neighboring communities.
            </dd>
            <dt>Where are the visitor centers located in the park?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">Visitor centers are located in Apgar, Logan Pass, and St. Mary. Each of these visitor
                centers, as well as the
                Many Glacier and Two Medicine Ranger Stations, have park rangers on duty throughout the summer months to
                answer
                questions and provide information. During the winter months, Apgar Visitor Center is open on week-ends.
            </dd>
            <dt>Do you have campgrounds in the park? Can I make a reservation?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">Glacier National Park has 13 campgrounds, which provide just over 1000 campsites. Most
                of the campgrounds are
                operated on a "first come, first serve" basis. Fish Creek and St. Mary Campgrounds will be available for
                reservation by calling 1-800-365-2267. Click here for more detailed information on camping.
            </dd>
            <dt>Is it possible to reserve a backcountry campsite?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">Reservations for backcountry campsites may be made in advance, beginning April 1 for
                the upcoming summer. For
                further information on backcountry camping and for making reservations, visit our website section on
                Backcountry
                Camping.
            </dd>
            <dt>Can I drive my RV along the Going-to-the-Sun Road?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">Vehicles, and vehicle combinations, longer than 21 feet (including bumpers) or wider
                than 8 feet (including
                mirrors) are prohibited between Avalanche Campground and the Sun Point parking area. You may however,
                drive to
                Avalanche if traveling east, and to Sun Point, if traveling west. Vehicles over 10 feet in height may
                have
                difficulty driving west from Logan Pass due to rock overhangs. Stock trucks and trailers may access
                Packers
                Roost and Siyeh Bend.
